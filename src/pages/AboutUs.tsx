                The problem a lot of people have is finding quality brass for
                the caliber they shoot. We manufacture high-quality reloading
                brass cartridges for vintage, obsolete, hard to find, and
                wildcat calibers. All cartridges are made to SAAMI, CIP, or
                tolerances provided to us. Our unique process allows us to
                manufacture over 1,500 different cartridges at tolerances up to
                0.0005”. We manufacture reloading brass cartridges for any
                firearm, and if you are seeking quality products made in the
                USA, then you are at the right place. The draw process has been
                used for cartridge manufacturing since the 19th century and
                manufacturers have been able to develop this process to produce
                high volumes of brass cases. Draw cartridge manufactures have
                tested many different types of materials over the years and the
                best material for this process is a brass alloy with a mixture
                of 70% copper and 30% zinc. When brass is annealed at 250° C
                there is no visible change to the bonding of the grain
                structure, tensile strength, and elasticity. At 300° C, there is
                a microscopic change to the grain structure and at 350° the work
                hardness becomes softer and a fine grain structure can be seen.
                As temperatures increase the brass becomes fully annealed at
                750° C and large crystals can be seen. Temperatures above this
                point will cause damage to the brass and at 800°C, the brass is
                burned and should be scrapped. When brass is cold-worked it
                hardens and done by bending, drawing, compressing, and so forth.
                This increases the tensile strength and decreases its
                elasticity. To accommodate today’s high-pressure cartridges
                brass must both have a high tensile strength to withstand
                pressure spikes and elasticity to seal the chamber from any gas
                blowback. The draw process begins using a brass cup that is
                annealed and cleaned to remove any scale build-up that might
                have occurred. During the first draw, the cup is pushed through
                a die with a punch and extruded to lengthen the cup. It has
                become work-hardened and has to be annealed and washed for the
                second draw. Typically a cartridge will go through 4 draws
                before it is ready to go to the next stage. The case head will
                be turned, primer pockets, flash holes, headstamps, and necks
                are done to complete the manufacturing process. When the neck is
                formed the cartridge is annealed again and is then polished for
                shipping. During each annealing, the temperature is reduced to
                work harden the case for higher tensile strength and elasticity.
                The final annealing is to the body of the case and is at a lower
                temperature, so it won’t affect the case head hardness. While
                the draw process is capable of mass production, it is not able
                to easily produce consistent case head hardness, case weight,
                case volume, and case concentricity. At RCC Brass™, we have
                taken those variables out of the manufacturing process as we
                have our C260 cartridge brass hammer-forged into a tight
                molecular grain structure with high tensile strength and 15%
                elasticity. We machine all our cases on CNC lathes and mills and
                our case weight, case volume, and our case concentricity are the
                best available in the industry. We don’t anneal the case head as
                it is hammer forged to a high tensile strength which gives us
                the same hardness for each case. Since we use CNC equipment to
                manufacture our reloading brass, case weight is nearly
                identical, the case volume is too, and our case concentricity is
                held to a 0.001”. Since we are not held back by the limitations
                of a draw system, we are able to use higher strength alloys to
                manufacture cartridges. Our new C272 brass alloy has a much
                higher tensile strength and tighter molecular grain structure
                than C260 brass, without losing the needed elasticity. Test
                results have been very positive as we’ve had reports of
                increased in velocity and energy and lower shot deviations
                versus C260 drawn brass. But the test is what you can do with
                RCC Brass™. We are proudly Made in the U.S.A.
